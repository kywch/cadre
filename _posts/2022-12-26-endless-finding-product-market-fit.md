> **4.  The Trifecta**
>
> An early advisor of SnapChat once told me a story.  About a few months after launch SnapChat had about 200K downloads, 100K daily active users, and those 100K DAU’s were sending on average 1 Million pictures a day (10/DAU).

> Snapchat had the trifecta.  
>
> 1. Non-Trivial Top Line Growth(Snapchat - 200K downloads)
> 2. Retention (50% of downloads were active Daily)
> 3. Meaningful Usage (The users just weren’t coming back daily, but there were taking a meaningful action - sending 10 pictures a day on average) 
>
> In my opinion, when and only when you have these three things can you say with close to 100% certainty you have product market fit among a meaningful market.
