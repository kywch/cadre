> Do Profiling in Onboarding (for increased activation & engagement)
> - No more than 6 questions
> - On no more than 3 screens
> - Give customers an explanation for why you are asking
> - Immediately remove questions if you are not using the data
 
> Implement Reverse Trials in Freemium (for increased conversion rates)
> Pro Tip: One trial is not enough. If you have an engaged freemium user base, do trial-restarts as well! Whether it’s timed (say, every 6 months), aligned by external triggers (big launch moments), or even just prompted by feature walls in the product, additional trials provide an excellent way to continue exposing your user base to new features and boosting your conversion rates.

> Focus on Monetization Awareness (for increased conversion rates)
> - Monetization awareness is a measure of your customers’ understanding of what you are selling. A lot of products miss the absolute basics—everything available in a higher-tier paid plan should be visible in the lower tiers, either through a feature wall or usage messaging.
> -  My favorite examples use a simple pattern: muted feature background, some sort of lock icon, and ‘Amazon’-gold color upgrade buttons (you’ve heard it right, Amazon has trained our brains to recognize their ‘add to cart’ gold color as a monetization related trigger. It performs better than any other color…)
> - To understand how prevalent this issue is, run a survey across your lower-tier customers, asking them what they think is included in higher-end plans. I guarantee that you will be shocked with the results, with at least 75% having no idea. 

> Improve Load Times (to grow everything faster)
> - one of the companies I work for did an analysis on conversion rates on checkout pages that load under 5 seconds, vs. those that take longer than 5 seconds. The results were shocking: a whopping 40% increase in confirmed orders when the page loads under 5 seconds. That's massive… 40%! Really let that number marinate for a moment.
