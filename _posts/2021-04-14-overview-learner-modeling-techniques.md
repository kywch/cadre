> Learner modeling is a basis of personalized, adaptive learning. The research literature provides a wide range of modeling approaches, but it does not provide guidance for choosing a model suitable for a particular situation.
>
> We provide a systematic and up-to-date overview of current approaches to tracing learnersâ€™ knowledge and skill across interaction with multiple items, focusing in particular on the widely used Bayesian knowledge tracing and logistic models. 
>
> We discuss factors that influence the choice of a model and highlight the importance of the learner modeling context: models are used for different purposes and deal with different types of learning processes. We also consider methodological issues in the evaluation of learner models and their relation to the modeling context. 
>
> Overall, the overview provides basic guidelines for both researchers and practitioners and identifies areas that require further clarification in future research.
