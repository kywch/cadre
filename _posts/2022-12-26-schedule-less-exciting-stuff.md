> The engineering department at Fitbit held an event on the last Friday of every month called “Dev Awesome Day.” Everyone in the org agreed to suspend meetings and avoid any new software development, instead focusing solely on tidying up what had already been written. This included cleaning up tech debt, creating unit tests, or writing clarifying documentation.

> When I joined Mozilla in 2019 as the head of the Firefox Data Science team, I wanted to bring the spirit of Dev Awesome Day with me. I decided to start by having the team focus on [documentation](https://scientistemily.substack.com/p/getting-started?s=w), something we were in dire need of. To get the ball rolling, I kept the definition of the term fairly loose; documentation could mean either something beneficial for the team (such as onboarding materials, information on data provenance, etc), something helpful for our product stakeholders, or something for the public, such as blog posts about how data worked at Mozilla.

> The biggest challenge was making sure everyone actually did block off their calendars and to give stakeholders enough notice so that they could prioritize the day for thoughtful writing. At Fitbit, the whole company recognized and supported the Engineering org’s Dev Awesome Day, which meant that there was less interruption. Generally though, Doc Days were a success, and we did manage to clean up and add a lot to our documentation, taking it from one of those things that always ended up on the back-burner to a prioritized task that the team made time for.
