> This study aimed to operationalize [Hirsh-Pasek, Zosh, and colleagues' Four Pillars of Learning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275410459_Putting_Education_in_Educational_Apps_Lessons_From_the_Science_of_Learning) (2015) into a reliable coding scheme
> -  Pillar 1: Active Learning, 
> -  Pillar 2: Engagement in the Learning Process, 
> -  Pillar 3: Meaningful Learning, 
> -  Pillar 4: Social Interaction), 
>
> describe the educational quality of commercially available apps, and examine differences in educational quality between free and paid apps.
>
> We analyzed 100 children’s educational apps with the highest downloads from Google Play and Apple app stores, as well as 24 apps most frequently played by preschool-age children in a longitudinal cohort study. We developed a coding scheme in which each app earned a value of 0–3 for each Pillar, defining lower-quality apps as those scoring ≤4, summed across the Four Pillars.
>
> Overall scores were low across all Pillars. Free apps had significantly lower Pillar 2 (Engagement in Learning Process) scores (t-test, *p* < .0001) and overall scores (t-test, *p* < .0047) when compared to paid apps, **due to the presence of distracting enhancements.** These results highlight the need for improved design of educational apps guided by developmental science.

> **Putting Education in “Educational” Apps: Lessons From the Science of Learning (Hirsh-Pasek et al., 2015)**
>
> We build upon decades of work on the Science of Learning, which has examined how children learn best. From this work, we abstract a set of principles for two ultimate goals. 
> - First, we aim to guide researchers, educators, and designers in evidence-based app development. 
> - Second, by creating an evidence-based guide, we hope to set a new standard for evaluating and selecting the most effective existing children’s apps. 
>
> In short, we will show how the design and use of educational apps aligns with known processes of children’s learning and development and offer a framework that can be used by parents and designers alike. 
>
> Apps designed to promote active, engaged, meaningful, and socially interactive learning—four “pillars” of learning—within the context of a supported learning goal are considered educational.
