> Previous research indicates that writing practice may be more beneficial than nonmotor practice for letter learning. Here, we report a training study comparing typing, visual, and writing learning conditions in adults (*N* = 42). We investigated the behavioral consequences of learning modality on literacy learning and evaluated the nature of the learned letter representations. Specifically, the study addressed three questions. 
>
> * First, are the benefits of handwriting practice due to motor learning per se or to other incidental factors? 
> * Second, do the benefits generalize to untrained tasks? And 
> * third, does handwriting practice lead to learning and strengthening only of motor representations or of other types of representations as well? 
>
> Our results clearly show that **handwriting compared with nonmotor practice produces faster learning and greater generalization to untrained tasks** than previously reported. Furthermore, only handwriting practice leads to learning of both motor and amodal symbolic letter representations.

> an experiment in which 42 people were taught the Arabic alphabet, split into three groups of learners: writers, typers, and video watchers.
>
> >  Everyone learned the letters one at a time by watching videos of them being written along with hearing names and sounds. After being introduced to each letter, the three groups would attempt to learn what they just saw and heard in different ways. The video group got an on-screen flash of a letter and had to say if it was the same letter they'd just seen. The typers would have to find the letter on the keyboard. The writers had to copy the letter with pen and paper.
>
> At the end, after as many as six sessions, everyone could recognize the letters and made few mistakes when tested. But the writing group reached this level of proficiency faster than the other groups—a few of them in just two sessions.
>
> Next the researchers wanted to determine to what extent, if at all, the groups could generalize this new knowledge. In other words, they could all recognize the letters, but could anyone really use them like a pro, by writing with them, using them to spell new words, and using them to read unfamiliar words?
>
> **The writing group was better—decisively—in all of those things.****
>
> "The main lesson is that even though they were all good at recognizing letters, the writing training was the best at every other measure. And they required less time to get there," Wiley said.
>
> Although the participants in the study were adults, Wiley and Rapp expect they'd see the same results in children. The findings have implications for classrooms, where pencils and notebooks have taken a backseat in recent years to tablets and laptops, and teaching cursive handwriting is all but extinct.
