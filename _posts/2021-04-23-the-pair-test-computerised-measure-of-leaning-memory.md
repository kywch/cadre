> We developed a tablet-based paired-associate learning paradigm, the Pair Test, based on neurocognitive models of learning and memory. The aims are to (i) establish the utility of this novel memory tool for use with children across a wide age range, and (ii) examine test validity, reliability and reproducibility of the construct. The convergent validity of the test was found to be adequate, and higher test reliability was shown for the Pair Test compared to standardised measures.

> The Pair Test is able to capture developmental changes in memory, and can therefore **chart the developmental trajectory of memory and learning functions across childhood and adolescence**. Finally, we used this novel instrument to acquire normative data from **130 typically developing children, aged 8â€“18 years**. Age-stratified normative data are provided for learning, delayed recall and delayed recognition, for measures of verbal and non-verbal memory.
