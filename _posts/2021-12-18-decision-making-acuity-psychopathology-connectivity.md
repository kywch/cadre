> Decision-making is a cognitive process of central importance for the quality of our lives. Here, we ask whether a common factor underpins our diverse decision-making abilities. 
>
> We obtained 32 decision-making measures from 830 young people and **identified a common factor that we call “decision acuity,” which was distinct from IQ and reflected a generic decision-making ability.** Decision acuity was decreased in those with aberrant thinking and low general social functioning. 
>
> Crucially, **decision acuity and IQ had dissociable brain signatures,** in terms of their associated neural networks of resting-state functional connectivity. Decision acuity was reliably measured, and its relationship with functional connectivity was also stable when measured in the same individuals 18 months later. 
>
> Thus, our behavioral and brain data identify a new cognitive construct that underpins decision-making ability across multiple domains. This construct may be important for understanding mental health, particularly regarding poor social function and aberrant thought patterns.
