> This initiative examined systematically the extent to which a large set of archival research findings generalizes across contexts. We repeated the key analyses for 29 original strategic management effects in the same context (direct reproduction) as well as in 52 novel time periods and geographies; 
>
> 45% of the reproductions returned results matching the original reports together with 55% of tests in different spans of years and 40% of tests in novel geographies. Some original findings were associated with multiple new tests. 
>
> Reproducibility was the best predictor of generalizabilityâ€”for the findings that proved directly reproducible, 84% emerged in other available time periods and 57% emerged in other geographies. 
>
> Overall, only limited empirical evidence emerged for context sensitivity. In a forecasting survey, independent scientists were able to anticipate which effects would find support in tests in new samples.

> **Original findings that were statistically reliable in the first place were typically obtained again in novel tests, suggesting surprisingly little sensitivity to context.** For some social scientific areas of inquiry, results from a specific time and place can be a meaningful guide as to what will be observed more generally.

> In our frequentist analyses using the *P* < 0.05 criterion for statistical significance, 55% of the original findings regarding strategic decisions by corporations extended to alternative time periods, and 40% extended to separate geographic areas.
>
> More meaningfully, reproducibility was empirically correlated with generalizability; of the directly reproducible findings, 84% generalized to other time periods and 57% generalized to other nations and territories. In a forecasting survey, scientists proved overly optimistic about direct reproducibility, predicting a reproducibility rate of 71%, yet were accurate about cross-temporal generalizability, anticipating a success rate of 57% that closely aligned with the realized results.
