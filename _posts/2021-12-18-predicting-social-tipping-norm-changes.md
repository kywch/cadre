> The ability to predict when societies will replace one social norm for another can have significant implications for welfare, especially when norms are detrimental. A popular theory poses that the pressure to conform to social norms creates tipping thresholds which, once passed, propel societies toward an alternative state. Predicting when societies will reach a tipping threshold, however, has been a major challenge because of the lack of experimental data for evaluating competing models. 
>
> We present evidence from a large-scale laboratory experiment designed to test the theoretical predictions of a threshold model for social tipping and norm change. In our setting, **societal preferences change gradually, forcing individuals to weigh the benefit from deviating from the norm against the cost from not conforming to the behavior of others.** 
>
> We show that the model correctly predicts in 96% of instances when a society will succeed or fail to abandon a detrimental norm. **Strikingly, we observe widespread persistence of detrimental norms even when individuals determine the cost for nonconformity themselves as they set the latter too high.** 
>
> **Interventions that facilitate a common understanding of the benefits from change help most societies abandon detrimental norms.** 
>
> We also show that **instigators of change tend to be more risk tolerant and to dislike conformity more.** 
>
> Our findings demonstrate the value of threshold models for understanding social tipping in a broad range of social settings and for designing policies to promote welfare.
