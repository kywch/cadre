> We hypothesize that behavioral patterns of people are reflected in how they interact with their mobile devices and that continuous sensor data passively collected from their phones and wearables can infer their job performance. Specifically, we study day-today job performance (improvement, no change, decline) of N=298 information workers using mobile sensing data and offer data-driven insights into what data patterns may lead to a high-performing day. 
>
> Through analyzing workers' mobile sensing data, we predict their performance on a handful of job performance questionnaires with an F-1 score of 75%. In addition, through numerical analysis of the model, we get insights into how individuals must change their behavior so that the model predicts improvements in their job performance.

> For instance, one worker may benefit if they put their phone down and reduce their screen time, while another worker may benefit from getting more sleep.

> "Compared to low performers, high performers display greater consistency in the time they arrive and leave work," said Pino Audia, a professor of Management and Organizations at the Tuck School of Business, a senior scientist on the study team, and a co-author of the study. "This dramatically reduces the negative impacts of commuting variability and suggests that the secret to high performance may lie in sticking to better routines."
>
> Additional differences in the commuting patterns of high and low performers include:
>
> - High performers tend to have physiological indicators that are consistent with physical fitness and stress resilience.
> - Low performers have higher stress levels in the times before, during, and after commutes.
> - Low performers use their phone more during their commutes.
>
> The study also demonstrates that not all commutes can be bad. By tracking commuting traits such as walking distance and steps, the research confirms that commuters who are involved in active forms of commuting typically experience increased productivity at work.
