> Theories of scientific and technological change view discovery and invention as endogenous processes[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR1),[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR2), wherein previous accumulated knowledge enables future progress by allowing researchers to, in Newton’s words, ‘stand on the shoulders of giants’[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR3),[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR4),[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR5),[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR6),[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR7). Recent decades have witnessed exponential growth in the volume of new scientific and technological knowledge, thereby creating conditions that should be ripe for major advances[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR8),[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR9). Yet contrary to this view, studies suggest that progress is slowing in several major fields[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR10),[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR11).

> Here, we analyse these claims at scale across six decades, using data on 45 million papers and 3.9 million patents from six large-scale datasets, together with a new quantitative metric—**the CD index[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR12)—that characterizes how papers and patents change networks of citations in science and technology.** 
>
> We find that papers and patents are increasingly less likely to break with the past in ways that push science and technology in new directions. This pattern holds universally across fields and is robust across multiple different citation- and text-based metrics[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR1),[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR13),[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR14),[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR15),[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR16),[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR17). Subsequently, we link this decline in disruptiveness to a narrowing in the use of previous knowledge, allowing us to reconcile the patterns we observe with the ‘shoulders of giants’ view.

> We find that the observed declines are unlikely to be driven by changes in the quality of published science, citation practices or field-specific factors. Overall, our results suggest that slowing rates of disruption may reflect a fundamental shift in the nature of science and technology.

> We quantify this distinction using a measure—the CD index[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR12)—that characterizes the consolidating or disruptive nature of science and technology (Fig. [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#Fig1)). The intuition is that **if a paper or patent is disruptive, the subsequent work that cites it is less likely to also cite its predecessors; for future researchers, the ideas that went into its production are less relevant (for example, Pauling’s triple helix)**. If a paper or patent is consolidating, subsequent work that cites it is also more likely to cite its predecessors; for future researchers, the knowledge upon which the work builds is still (and perhaps more) relevant (for example, the theorems Kohn and Sham used).

> The CD index ranges from −1 (consolidating) to 1 (disruptive). We measure the CD index five years after the year of each paper’s publication (indicated by CD5, see Extended Data Fig. [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#Fig7) for the distribution of CD5 among papers and patents and Extended Data Fig. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#Fig8) for analyses using alternative windows)[33](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR33). For example, Watson and Crick and Kohn and Sham both received over a hundred citations within five years of being published. However, the Kohn and Sham paper has a CD5 of −0.22 (indicating consolidation), whereas the Watson and Crick paper has a CD5 of 0.62 (indicating disruption). The CD index has been validated extensively in previous research, including through correlation with expert assessments[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR12),[34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x#ref-CR34).
