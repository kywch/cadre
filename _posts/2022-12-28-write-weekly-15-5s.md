> A 15-5 is a weekly update that takes 15 minutes to write and 5 minutes to read. I learned about it from [Gergely Orosz](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/becoming-a-better-writer-in-tech/) and [Will Larson](https://lethain.com/weekly-updates/). (They call it the 5-15 but I’ve remembered it as 15-5 because the 15-min writing comes before the 5-min reading.) I’ve been writing weekly 15-5s over the past few months and found it helpful for myself and the team.

> **First, it provides visibility in a scalable way.** My intended reader is my manager and team, though other stakeholders have found it useful enough and subscribed. As a result, we spend less time on status updates during 1-on-1s and more time on strategic issues.
>
> **Second, it tracks how productive (or unproductive) I’ve been.** Each week, I log the main chunks of work and outcomes. This includes blockers, bottlenecks, and any friction in general. Over time, patterns emerge on what’s slowing down the team most.
>
> **Third, it documents all artifacts I’ve created or reviewed.** In my work, this is mostly code (e.g., repos, pull requests), documents, and experiments and metrics. I also include documents I’ve reviewed and provided feedback on. A handful of docs each week leads to 200+ documents a year! Having a bullet point on the topic, author, and a link to the document makes it easy to retrieve.

> **Fourth, it earns trust.** Providing visibility helps the team know what I’ve shipped and am blocked by, and allows them to provide feedback or course correct. This helps prevent data scientists from going down rabbit holes that don’t provide value to customers or the business, something we’re occasionally guilty of.

> To get started, just set up a personal page on your org’s internal wiki or confluence. At the end of each week, summarize your work as a new 15-5 entry. It’s also useful to document key decisions, such as agreement that a feature is out of scope or on the tech stack.
