> During pandemics, effective nonpharmaceutical interventions encourage people to adjust their behavior in fast-changing environments in which exponential dynamics aggravate the conflict between the individual benefits of risk-taking and its social costs. Policy-makers need to know which interventions are most likely to promote socially advantageous behaviors. 
>
> We designed a tool for initial evaluations of the effectiveness of large-scale interventions, the transmission game framework, which integrates simulations of outbreak dynamics into large-group experiments with monetary stakes. In two studies (*n* = 700), we found substantial differences in the effectiveness of five behavioral interventions. 
>
> **A simple injunctive-norms message (MES) proved most effective, followed by two interventions boosting participantsâ€™ ability to anticipate the consequences of risky behavior (COI, SIM).** Interventions featuring descriptive norms (LFO) or concurrent risk information (OBS) failed to reduce risk-taking.
