> How do you help teams focus on WHAT they are measuring instead of fixating on HOW they will measure it? Here’s a decent activity that helps teams put it all together.

> The prompt:
>
> **Right now we are working to improve the ______[A]________  ______[B]________ for ______[C]_______ which we could potentially measure by tracking _____[D]_______.**

> ## A and B—Variable
>
> Together, A and B specify the variable: For A, I ask people to pick from a selection of noun/preposition pairs. The pair is connected to a variable (B), and describes disposition of, state of, quality of, etc. The trick here is that I *force* people to get specific by giving them lots of options (25):

> ## C—For Who
>
> In an ideal world, we would describe the FOR WHO. This step isn’t required in all situations but is extremely valuable. 

> ## D—Measurement
>
> Next, we brainstorm some potential ways to measure our impact on the variable.

> Right now, we are working to improve the **(A)** probability that **(B)** customers will create >=2 functional integrations within 15d of the first product use for **(C)** customers arriving through organic search who view integration content. We could potentially measure this tracking: 
>
> - % that achieve the milestone
> - By channel
> - Look at drop-offs in the journey
> - Time, distribution of time
