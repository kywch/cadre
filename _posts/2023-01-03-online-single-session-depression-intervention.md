> The COVID-19 pandemic has potentially increased the risk for adolescent depression. Even pre-pandemic, <50% of youth with depression accessed care, highlighting needs for accessible interventions. 
>
> Accordingly, this randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: [NCT04634903](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04634903)) tested online single-session interventions (SSIs) during COVID-19 in adolescents with elevated depression symptoms (*N* = 2,452, ages 13–16). 
>
> Adolescents from all 50 US states, recruited via social media, were randomized to **one of three SSIs: a behavioural activation SSI, an SSI teaching that traits are malleable and a supportive control.** We tested each SSI’s effects on post-intervention outcomes (hopelessness and agency) and three-month outcomes (depression, hopelessness, agency, generalized anxiety, COVID-19-related trauma and restrictive eating). 
>
> Compared with the control, both active SSIs reduced three-month depressive symptoms (Cohen’s *d* = 0.18), decreased post-intervention and three-month hopelessness (*d* = 0.16–0.28), increased post-intervention agency (*d* = 0.15–0.31) and reduced three-month restrictive eating (*d* = 0.12–17). 
>
> Several differences between active SSIs emerged. These results confirm the utility of free-of-charge, online SSIs for high-symptom adolescents, even in the high-stress COVID-19 context.

> To date, systematic and narrative reviews have identified two types of SSI that have reduced adolescent depression symptoms[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0#ref-CR16),[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0#ref-CR17). 
>
> **The first is a growth mindset (GM) SSI, an online programme teaching that personal traits are malleable, which has prevented and reduced adolescent depression in multiple trials**[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0?utm_source=pocket_reader#ref-CR18),[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0?utm_source=pocket_reader#ref-CR19),[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0?utm_source=pocket_reader#ref-CR20),[21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0?utm_source=pocket_reader#ref-CR21),[22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0#ref-CR22). As examples, a GM-SSI led to nine-month depression symptom reductions in high-symptom adolescents, versus a supportive control (Cohen’s *d* = 0.60 and 0.32 per parent and youth reports)[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0#ref-CR19). In two school-based randomized trials, GM-SSIs reduced adolescent depressive symptoms versus active controls from four- to nine-month follow-ups[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0#ref-CR18),[21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0#ref-CR21),[22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0#ref-CR22).

> **The second type, a behavioural activation (BA) SSI, promotes values-based activity engagement to elicit pleasure and accomplishment**[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0?utm_source=pocket_reader#ref-CR23),[24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0?utm_source=pocket_reader#ref-CR24),[25](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0#ref-CR25). In randomized trials, therapist-guided BA-SSIs have reduced depressive symptoms in moderately depressed adolescents across two weeks (*d* = 1.61) and one month (*d* = 0.57)[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0#ref-CR23),[24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0#ref-CR24). Furthermore, in an open trial, high-symptom adolescents reported increases in perceived problem-solving ability and agency after completing an online, self-guided BA-SSI; they also endorsed the BA-SSI’s overall acceptability and helpfulness[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01235-0#ref-CR20). 
>
> **Notably, the GM-SSI and BA-SSI are the only two fully self-guided, single-session, digital interventions that have shown acceptability and (at minimum) short-term utility among US adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms.** However, their relative effectiveness has yet to be rigorously assessed, creating a need to understand their potentially differential promise as widely scaled supports for youth depression and related difficulties.
