> Facebook and Google, for example, can clearly make a lot of money by using their data to serve better ads. Netflix can clearly improve its business by using viewership logs to better promote the content that they offer. Uber can clearly make their service better by shortening wait times. And all of these companies operate at such an extraordinary scale that seemingly trivial improvements are amplified into meaningful financial gains. In these contexts, data has tremendous leverage—leverage that, even if used clumsily, could still produce impressive results.

> In other words, rather than being exemplars of good data practices because they were so good, it’s possible that they’re exemplars because they didn’t have to be that good.

> In that light, when the rest of us struggle to keep up, it’s not because we don’t have their tools or cultures; it’s because we don’t have their data. The data of a mid-sized B2B SaaS product simply doesn’t have the potential energy of Google’s search histories, or of an Amazon’s browsing logs. If the latter examples are the new oil, the former is a new peat bog. No matter how good the tools are that clean and analyze it, how skilled the engineers are who are working on it, or how mature the culture is around it, it’ll never burn as hot or as bright. 

> For companies like **Netflix and Airbnb—the ones whose data is high-grade oil**—the margins on data investments are similarly high. Inefficiencies don’t drown out the benefit. But **companies that are harvesting peat, for whom data has fewer clear applications, don’t have those margins**. For them, emulating the practices of high-margin businesses—i.e., those that can afford inefficiencies in their data initiatives—is a trap. Peat suppliers can’t copy the refinement methods and cost structures of oil producers and still expect to come out ahead; small SaaS businesses can’t operate as though their data has anywhere near the same value as Uber’s or Airbnb’s. And yet, that’s what most of us do—we assume that there are diamonds buried in our rough data, if only we clean it properly, analyze it effectively, or stuff it through the right YC startup's new tool.

> I think we have to be more targeted in our ambitions, as both data teams and as data vendors. Focus on proven tooling and use cases—reporting, dare I say decision support—over moonshots. **Focus on identifying which few datasets have real value, rather than assuming it’s all of them**. And perhaps most of all, rather than trying to copy the companies whose oil fields made them rich, focus on the learning from the businesses that are build on peat bogs.
