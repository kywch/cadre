> These 9 lessons cost me $120k

> 1. Focus will unf*** you
> Productivity is more a quality game than a quantity one. Most people replace the important with the urgent, and the 2 are rarely the same. It means completing your most impactful tasks above all others.

> 2. Who not how
> Many problems can be boiled down to “who” problems. Whether it’s a hire, coach, or even a friend, “Rather than trying to figure out how to do something,” Jordan says, “you’re better off finding who can help you do it.”

> 4. Don’t just set goals, set sacrifices
> Every goal requires a sacrificial toll. What are you willing to pay? What project are you willing to give up? Outline, underline, and deadline the sacrifices you need to make to reach a goal.

> 5. The upside/downside matrix
> The matrix helps you make business decisions by clearly organizing actions’ upsides and downsides. It also has you write down potential remedies to de-risk and manage them.

> 6. Keep a “someday maybe” list
> Jordan taught me to add these ideas to a “someday maybe” list — a parking lot of ideas where I know I can eventually go and take some for a ride, but in the meantime, it frees up my head to focus on the now.

> 7. Be happy with the backseat
> Let the people who steal your ideas, who take the credit, who push your buttons, drive for a minute. It’s a signal you’re doing something right, and it often helps drive you faster to your destination.

> 8. Be easy to find, hard to reach
> The big question is, how do you decide what’s worth responding to and what isn’t?
> My anti-goals are things like: being an employee, or meeting with people who want to “pick my brain…”
> Because if you don’t use NO, other people’s goals become your own. It’s like Steve Jobs said, “Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1000 things.”
