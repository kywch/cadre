### [Retention engineering](https://retentioneering.github.io/retentioneering-tools/_build/html/what_is_rete.html): 

Retentioneering is a Python framework and library to assist product analysts and marketing analysts as it makes it easier to process and analyze clickstreams, event streams, trajectories, and event logs. You can segment users, clients (agents), build ML pipelines to predict agent category or probability of target event based on historical data.
