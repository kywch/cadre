> Young children have increasing access to interactive applications (apps) at home and at school. Existing research is clear on the potential dangers of overuse of screens, but there is less clarity around the extent to which interactive apps may be helpful in supporting early learning. In this systematic review, we present a narrative synthesis of studies examining whether children <6 years can learn from interactive apps.
>
> Studies were included if the study design was randomized or nonrandomized controlled (quasi-experimental), the sample mean age was <6 years, the intervention involved children playing with an interactive app, and academic, cognitive, or social-emotional skill outcomes were measured. Of 1447 studies, 35 were included.
>
> **Evidence of a learning benefit of interactive app use for early academic skills was found across multiple studies, particularly for early mathematics learning in typically developing children.** Researchers did not find evidence of an intervention effect for apps aiming to improve social communication skills in children with autism spectrum disorder.
>
> Risk of bias was unclear for many studies because of inadequate reporting. Studies were highly heterogenous in interventions, outcomes, and study design, making comparisons of results across studies difficult.
>
> There is emerging evidence to suggest that interactive apps may be useful and accessible tools for supporting early academic development. More research is needed to evaluate both the potential of educational apps to support early learning, and their limitations.

> A majority of studies comparing math or [language art] (LA; letter naming and writing, phonological awareness) outcomes in children using interactive apps to controls receiving equivalent regular classroom or small-group instruction found more favorable outcomes for the interactive app condition. In addition, although study effect sizes varied widely, large effects were reported for school-based studies of math and LA learning. For example, the largest effect sizes in math were from a school-based 22-week intervention using the app Math Shelf,[27](javascript:;) whereas the largest effect sizes in LA were from a school-based 6-week intervention using a phonological awareness app.[48](javascript:;) These findings are notable because they suggest the addition of interactive touchscreen technology may afford a learning advantage for early academic learning exceeding traditional modes of instruction and are consistent with the theory that interactive apps are well suited to support active, repeated, and varied practice of skills.[2](javascript:;),[16](javascript:;)
