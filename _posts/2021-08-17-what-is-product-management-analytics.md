> **Goals, KPIs and metrics**
> Though often used interchangeably, goals, key performance indicators (KPIs), and metrics are not the same. Rather, they sit in a hierarchy, with goals on top. Goals are a company’s highest level priority, such as driving revenue; KPIs measure progress toward goals; and metrics measure progress toward KPIs. Once teams select their goals and KPIs, they can determine the metrics that support them.

> **Common metrics for product management analytics**
> Hopefully, it’s clear by now the importance of selecting only those metrics that help you determine your product’s success. Tracking too many metrics often proves unmanageable—like a car dashboard with too many gauges. Every metric that’s chosen should be clearly defined, simple to collect, and roll up into KPIs and goals.
