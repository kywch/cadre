> The Data Platform team provides the data and compute infrastructure—along with a collection of internal SaaS products—that allow the vertically-aligned data scientists to effectively and efficiently carry out analysis, write their algorithms, and put them into production. 
>
> The platform nicely encapsulates properties like data distribution, parallelization, auto-scaling, failover, etc. This allows the data scientists to focus mostly on the *science* aspect yet still enjoy the benefits of a scalable system. And, the **data platform engineers** focusing on building… well, platforms. That is, they are not burdened with business logic and requirements for which they don’t have the context. 
>
> That is the job of the **full-stack data scientists**. At its heart is the idea that "Engineers Shouldn't Write ETL." Our Data Platform team enables data scientists to carry algorithm development all the way from concept to production.
