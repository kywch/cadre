> What is the relationship between money and well-being? 
>
> Research distinguishes between two forms of well-being: people’s feelings during the moments of life (experienced well-being) and people’s evaluation of their lives when they pause and reflect (evaluative well-being). 
>
> Drawing on 1,725,994 experience-sampling reports from 33,391 employed US adults, the present results show that **both experienced and evaluative well-being increased linearly with log(income), with an equally steep slope for higher earners as for lower earners.** 
>
> **There was no evidence for an experienced well-being plateau above $75,000/y, contrary to some influential past research.** 
>
> There was also no evidence of an income threshold at which experienced and evaluative well-being diverged, suggesting that higher incomes are associated with both feeling better day-to-day and being more satisfied with life overall.
