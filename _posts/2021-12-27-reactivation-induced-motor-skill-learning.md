> Learning motor skills commonly requires repeated execution to achieve gains in performance. Motivated by memory reactivation frameworks predominantly originating from fear-conditioning studies in rodents, which have extended to humans, we asked the following: Could motor skill learning be achieved by brief memory reactivations? 
>
> To address this question, we had participants encode a motor sequence task in an initial test session, **followed by brief task reactivations of only 30 s each, conducted on separate days.** Learning was evaluated in a final retest session. 
>
> **The results showed that these brief reactivations induced significant motor skill learning gains.** 
>
> Nevertheless, the efficacy of reactivations was not consistent but **determined by the number of consecutive correct sequences tapped during memory reactivations. Highly continuous reactivations resulted in higher learning gains, similar to those induced by full extensive practice,** while lower continuity reactivations resulted in minimal learning gains. 
>
> These results were replicated in a new independent sample of subjects, suggesting that the quality of memory reactivation, reflected by its continuity, regulates the magnitude of learning gains. 
>
> In addition, the change in noninvasive brain stimulation measurements of corticospinal excitability evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation over primary motor cortex between pre- and postlearning correlated with retest and transfer performance. 
>
> These results demonstrate a unique form of rapid motor skill learning and may have far-reaching implications, for example, in accelerating motor rehabilitation following neurological injuries.
