> Collective intelligence (CI) is critical to solving many scientific, business, and other problems. We find strong support for a general factor of CI using meta-analytic methods in a dataset comprising 22 studies, including 5,279 individuals in 1,356 groups. CI can predict performance in a range of out-of-sample criterion tasks. 
>
> CI, in turn, is **most strongly predicted by group collaboration process**, followed by individual skill and group composition. 
>
> **The proportion of women in a group is a significant predictor of group performance, mediated by social perceptiveness.**
