> poetry: Sort out virtual environments for good, all your project definitions in pyproject.toml.

> black: You can have any code style until it is black. Stop worrying about formatting your code.

> ruff: New blazing fast linter, anything that black doesn't care about will be fixed here

> pytest: Testing, duh...

> pre-commit-hooks: Automate all of the above and forget about them.

> GitHub Actions: Run these on the remote as well, just to be sure.
