> In the dominant model-centric approach to AI, according to Ng, you collect all the data you can collect and develop a model good enough to deal with the noise in the data. The established process calls for holding the data fixed and iteratively improving the model until the desired results are achieved. In the nascent data-centric approach to AI, “consistency of data is paramount,” says Ng. To get to the right results, you hold the model or code fixed and iteratively improve the quality of the data.

> “The model and the code for many applications are basically a solved problem,” says Ng. “Now that the models have advanced to a certain point, we got to make the data work as well.” He sees a number of recent developments supporting his call for data-centric AI. As investments in AI projects spread from Internet-based, consumer-facing companies to other industries, the models are typically trained by 10,000 or less examples rather than millions of examples. That is a very good reason to pay greater attention to the quality of the data.
