> Does stunted upward mobility in an educational system impede beneficial psychological processes of learning? We predicted that growth mindsets of intelligence, a well-established psychological stimulant to learning, would be less potent in low-mobility, as compared to high-mobility, learning environments. 
>
> An analysis of a large cross-national dataset and a longitudinal experiment accumulated converging evidence for this hypothesis. Study 1 examined data from 15-y-old students across 30 countries (*n* = 235,141 persons). Replicating past findings, growth mindsets positively predicted students’ math, science, and reading literacy. More importantly, **the country-level indicator of educational mobility (i.e., the percentage of children from low-education households to graduate from tertiary education) moderated the effect of growth mindsets.** Depending on the subject, the gain in predicted academic performance from a one-unit increase in growth mindsets was reduced by 42 to 45% from a high-mobility to a low-mobility country. Results were robust with or without important covariates. 
>
> **Study 2 experimentally manipulated people’s perception of mobility in a carefully constructed learning environment. The moderating role of educational mobility was replicated and extended to learning behavior, which subsequently predicted performance.** Evidence further suggests that in high-mobility environments, both advantaged and disadvantaged learners benefited from growth mindsets, albeit likely through diverging mechanisms; when the effect of growth mindsets was attenuated in low-mobility environments, the potential for the disadvantaged to overcome the performance gap was also limited. 
>
> Implications for galvanizing the upward mobility of the disadvantaged, evaluating the effectiveness of mindset interventions, and conceptualizing social mobility from a psychological perspective are discussed.

### Perception of mobility manipulation

> From participants’ perspectives, they enrolled in a pilot program evaluating their “change perceptiveness,” a purported newly identified aspect of intelligence that predicts various positive life outcomes. Those who excelled at the end of the program would qualify for well-paid follow-up experiments and attractive internships.
>
> They would complete an initial assessment in the first session. Based on their performance, participants were told they would be allocated to one of two tracks: Track A or Track B, thereby referred to as the upper track and the lower track, respectively. In reality, they were given false performance feedback and allocated to the two tracks by random assignment.
>
> This preliminary banding supposedly informed them of their likelihood to qualify in the fourth session during the final assessment. Participants in the high-mobility condition were informed that, based on past data, the upper and the lower track had around 90% and 30% chance to qualify, respectively. In the low-mobility condition, the corresponding chances were 99% and 3%, respectively ([*SI Appendix*, section 2C](https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2011832118/-/DCSupplemental)).
