Maybe this is a reason why a clunky video chat over an unreliable connection feels hard.

> Clicking is one of the most robust metaphors for social connection. But how do we know when two people "click"? 
>
> We asked pairs of friends and strangers to talk with each other and rate their felt connection. **For both friends and strangers, speed in response was a robust predictor of feeling connected.** 
>
> Conversations with faster response times felt more connected than conversations with slower response times, and within conversations, connected moments had faster response times than less-connected moments. This effect was determined primarily by partner responsivity: **People felt more connected to the degree that their partner responded quickly to them** rather than by how quickly they responded to their partner. 
>
> The temporal scale of these effects (<250 ms) precludes conscious control, thus providing an honest signal of connection. 
>
> Using a round-robin design in each of six closed networks, we show that faster responders evoked greater feelings of connection across partners. 
>
> Finally, we demonstrate that **this signal is used by third-party listeners as a heuristic of how well people are connected**: Conversations with faster response times were perceived as more connected than the same conversations with slower response times. 
>
> Together, these findings suggest that response times comprise a robust and sufficient signal of whether two minds “click.”
