> Sustaining creativity is difficult. We identify the conditions that determine repeat production of novelty among first-time producers, and the psychological mechanism transmitting their effects. 
>
> Our theoretical model highlights that the novelty of a first production can lower the probability of creating a second production, particularly when the first production is bestowed with an award or recognition. This effect occurs primarily because individuals who win an award for a prior novel production experience a greater threat to their creative identity when anticipating having to produce follow-up novel work. 
>
> We test our theoretical model in three studies: an archival study of first-time cookbook authors in the United Kingdom and two experiments. Our results provide some support for our theoretical model—**award-winning producers of novel cookbooks (or ideas for them) are less likely to follow-up their initial production with a second one**, largely because of the potential erosion to a person’s creative identity that doing so may cause. 
>
> Our findings highlight the intricacies of sustaining creativity over time and offer insights into why some producers abandon their creative efforts.

> Baer and Deichmann conducted an experiment with business school students. Participants were asked to develop a concept for a potential cookbook. Half of the participants were told that their idea was "highly original and novel," while the other half were told their idea was "very solid and traditional." A subgroup of participants was also told that their ideas were "among the ideas most likely to make a big splash in the food community."
>
> Finally, participants had the option to develop a second cookbook concept or to build upon their original idea with a marketing plan. The experiment showed that when people produce a highly novel, award-winning idea, right out of the gate, they're less likely to produce a follow-up idea.

> "Participants experienced a greater threat to their creative identity when producers of award-winning, novel work were confronted with the possibility of having to continue on their creative journey by having to produce original work yet again," the authors concluded.

> Baer offered the following strategies for avoiding the potential negative effects of awards and instead using them to encourage creativity:
>
> 1. Make sure that rewards and recognition are not only offered for the outcome of the creative process -- a new product -- but **also for the process of developing the outcome**. For example: Have we challenged key assumptions? Have we tested our prototype properly?
> 2. Reward both success and learning from failure. What becomes a success is difficult to predict and often entails a fair amount of luck. Thus, success and failure often lay close together. **Learning from failure** can be immensely beneficial and should be encouraged.
> 3. Do not glorify someone who had one creative success by offering an outsized reward. If you want to glorify people, **celebrate those who can produce creative work repeatedly.**
