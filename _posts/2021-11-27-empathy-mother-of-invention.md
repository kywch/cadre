> According to the age-old proverb from Plato’s *Republic: necessity is the mother of invention*, the main motivation for creating new discoveries is the need for them. However, as well as the necessity factor, we argue that a very important aspect that influences invention and creativity is the *empathy factor*. 
>
> This mixed methods research investigated the impact of empathy instruction on the social and emotional skills of creativity in the UK Design and Technology (D&T) classroom. Pupils in year 9 (aged 13 to 14 years) from two schools were **assessed for their creativity levels using the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT)** both at the start and at the end of the academic school year. 
>
> In the intervening period, whereas the control school continued as normal with its usual D&T lessons, **the intervention school’s D&T lessons were replaced by a creativity tuition kit called Designing Our Tomorrow (DOT), which involves instruction in empathising.** Pupils from year 7 (aged 11 to 12 years) in a third school were given the DOT task alone and interviewed about their experiences of it. 
>
> Results showed that unlike the control school, whose emotional and cognitive creative scores in fact decreased over time, **the intervention school increased in its levels of emotional and cognitive creativity, as measured by the TTCT.** These quantitative as well as the subsequent qualitative interview findings and pupils’ portfolios suggest that **creativity can be taught and particularly via instruction that advocates the importance of empathising with the subject matter.** 
>
> The findings are discussed in relation to the need for a holistic approach to teaching, where social, emotional and cognitive dimensions of teaching and learning are needed to complete and enhance the learning experience for the D&T classroom and beyond.
