> Making it onto the shortlist is often a crucial early step toward professional advancement. **For under-represented candidates, one barrier to making the shortlist is the prevalence of informal recruitment practices (for example, colleague recommendations).** 
>
> The current research investigates informal shortlists generated in male-dominant domains (for example, technology executives) and tests a theory-driven intervention to increase the consideration of female candidates. 
>
> Across ten studies (*N* = 5,741) we asked individuals to generate an informal shortlist of candidates for a male-dominant role and then asked them to extend the list. **We consistently found more female candidates in the extended (versus initial) list.** 
>
> This longer shortlist effect occurs because continued response generation promotes divergence from the category prototype (for example, male technology executives). Studies 3 and 4 supported this mechanism, and study 5 tested the effect of shortlist length on selection decisions. 
>
> **This longer shortlist intervention is a low-cost and simple way to support gender equity efforts.**
