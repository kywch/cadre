> Drawing on research conducted by Mayer (2020), this article examines evidence-based principles for how to design effective instructional videos and shows how they are grounded in [cognitive theories](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/cognitive-theory) of learning and instruction. 
>
> Principles include 
>
> * multimedia (present words and graphics), 
> * coherence (avoid extraneous material in slides and script), 
> * signaling (highlight key material), 
> * redundancy (do not add captions that repeat the spoken words), 
> * spatial contiguity (place printed text next to corresponding part of graphic), 
> * temporal contiguity (present corresponding visual and verbal material at the same time), 
> * segmenting (break a complex slide into progressively presented parts), 
> * pre-training (provide pre-training in the names and characteristics of key concepts), 
> * modality (present words as spoken text), 
> * personalization (use conversational language), voice (use appealing human voice), 
> * image (do not display static image of instructor's face), 
> * embodiment (display gesturing instructor), and 
> * generative activity (add prompts for generative learning activity).
