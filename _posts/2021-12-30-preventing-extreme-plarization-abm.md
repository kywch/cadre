> Democracies require compromise. But compromise becomes almost impossible when voters are divided into diametrically opposed camps. The danger is that intolerance will grow, democratic norms will be undermined, and winners will be reluctant to let the losers ever regain power. 
>
> To better understand how polarization can be prevented, or at least slowed, **we developed a simple model in which people tend to be exposed to and attracted by views similar to their own, but are repulsed by views that are too dissimilar.** 
>
> The policy implications are described in terms of level of tolerance to other views, responsiveness to other views, exposure to dissimilar views, multiple ideological dimensions, economic self-interest, and external shocks.

> ## Attraction–Repulsion Rule.
>
> All actors have identical tolerance, T, that determines whether the result of an interaction is attractive or repulsive. If an actor tolerates the position of the other, the actor moves a fraction R (responsiveness) of the distance toward the other. Otherwise, the actor moves the same distance away from the other, subject to the boundaries.
>
> With low tolerance, even interactions between similar actors can result in repulsion, leaving little hope of avoiding runaway polarization with all actors holding extreme positions. Sufficiently high tolerance, on the other hand, leads to consensus at a single ideological position. At intermediate levels, a moderate majority can form that is flanked by repulsive extremists.

> First is the question of when ideological polarization becomes a runaway process leading to extremism. Intolerance is the key component of runaway polarization observed in our experiments ([Figs. 1](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/50/e2102139118#F1)–[3](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/50/e2102139118#F3)), especially when enhanced by high exposure that enables frequent repulsive interactions between dissimilar individuals ([Fig. 4](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/50/e2102139118#F4)).
>
> Our second question concerns policy: What interventions can prevent extreme polarization? Sufficiently high tolerance can prevent or dramatically slow polarization ([Figs. 1](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/50/e2102139118#F1) and [2](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/50/e2102139118#F2)). For example, when T=0.25, the population polarizes but only very slowly; the center forms but does not hold. A small increase in tolerance can prevent runaway polarization, but the critical value depends on other parameters such as responsiveness ([Fig. 3](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/50/e2102139118#F3)) and exposure ([Fig. 4](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/50/e2102139118#F4)).
>
> Strictly limiting exposure to dissimilar views, however, is an effective mechanism for avoiding rapid polarization ([Figs. 4](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/50/e2102139118#F4) and [5](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/50/e2102139118#F5)). This may, at first, appear contrary to practical experience: Encouraging interactions among those with different views might be expected to decrease polarization by fostering increased tolerance. However, the ARM treats tolerance and exposure as independent features of a population. If a population is stubbornly intolerant and on a trajectory to runaway polarization, low exposure decreases the probability of interactions between mutually intolerant groups.

> These results help resolve the controversy about whether contact between different groups tends to increase or decrease their hostility ([27](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/50/e2102139118#ref-27), [28](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/50/e2102139118#ref-28)). For example, school desegregation brought people of different races together, expecting that exposure to others would reduce hostility. However, experience in places like Boston in the 1970s ([29](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/50/e2102139118#ref-29)) show the opposite because the differences were too great and may have exacerbated preexisting hostility.
>
> Attraction to one’s preferred ideological position [based on economic-self interest (P)] is surprisingly effective at preventing polarization, even if this preference is very small compared to the influence of others. Under these conditions, the population tends to moderate ([Fig. 7](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/50/e2102139118#F7) and [*SI Appendix*, Fig. S6](https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2102139118/-/DCSupplemental)). This is perhaps the most promising result of the model, because it suggests a direction for policy intervention by which a polarizing dynamic could be moderated.
