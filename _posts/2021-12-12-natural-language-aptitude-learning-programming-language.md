> This experiment employed an individual differences approach to test the hypothesis that learning modern programming languages resembles second “natural” language learning in adulthood. 
>
> Behavioral and neural (resting-state EEG) indices of language aptitude were used along with numeracy and fluid cognitive measures (e.g., fluid reasoning, working memory, inhibitory control) as predictors. Rate of learning, programming accuracy, and post-test declarative knowledge were used as outcome measures in 36 individuals who participated in ten 45-minute Python training sessions. 
>
> The resulting models explained 50–72% of the variance in learning outcomes, with language aptitude measures explaining significant variance in each outcome even when the other factors competed for variance. Across outcome variables, fluid reasoning and working-memory capacity explained 34% of the variance, followed by language aptitude (17%), resting-state EEG power in beta and low-gamma bands (10%), and numeracy (2%). 
>
> These results provide a novel framework for understanding programming aptitude, suggesting that the importance of numeracy may be overestimated in modern programming education environments.

> ### Materials
>
> #### Rasch-based numeracy scale
>
> Numeracy was assessed using a Rasch-Based Numeracy Scale which was created by evaluating 18 numeracy questions across multiple measures and determining the 8 most predictive items[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8#ref-CR23). The test was computerized and untimed.
>
> #### Raven’s advanced progressive matrices (RAPM)
>
> This study used a shortened 18-item version of this task, which was developed by splitting the original 36 questions into two, difficulty-matched, subtests based on the data reported in[35](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8#ref-CR35). These parallel forms were previously used in our natural language aptitude research[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8#ref-CR20),[25](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8#ref-CR25).

> #### Simon task
>
> The Simon task is a non-verbal measure designed to assess susceptibility to stimulus-response interference. The version used herein, which consisted of 75% congruent and 25% incongruent trials, has been previously used to model individual differences in complex skill learning[36](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8#ref-CR36),[37](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8#ref-CR37).
>
> #### 3-Back task
>
> The N-Back Task is a measure designed to index working memory updating. In the 3-back version of the task, participants are presented with a stream of letters and are tasked with determining if the presented letter is the same or different from the letter presented three items ago. Participants respond “Same” or “Different” by pressing one of two designated buttons. Total task accuracy was calculated out of 80 items, and used as a metric of working memory updating.
>
> #### The probabilistic stimulus selection task (PSS)
>
> The PSS task is an implicit learning task which measures individual differences in sensitivity to positive and negative feedback[38](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8#ref-CR38). Sensitivity to positive feedback (Choose Accuracy) and negative feedback (Avoid Accuracy) are calculated independently and used as measures of interest.
>
> #### Attentional blink task (AB)
>
> The AB task is a measure of the temporal limitations of attention. In this task, participants are shown a rapid stream of serially presented letters, and are told to attend to two numbers embedded within the letter stream. The lag between the offset of the first number and the onset of the second number is varied such that the second number falls either inside (100–500 ms) or outside (<100 ms or >500 ms) the attentional blink window. The AB task used herein has been previously related to differences in language experience[39](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8#ref-CR39).
>
> #### Complex working memory span tasks
>
> Computerized Reading Span, Operation Span, and Symmetry Span[40](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8#ref-CR40),[41](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8#ref-CR41) were used to index working memory capacity. A single composite score was computed by z-transforming each individual span score and taking an average of the three scores.
>
> #### Modern language aptitude test (MLAT)
>
> All participants completed the MLAT[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8#ref-CR16), a standardized measure of second-language aptitude normed for native English speaking adults. The MLAT is a well-validated measure which has been shown to predict up to 30% of variability in language learning[42](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8#ref-CR42).
