> Welcome to MineRL. We want to build agents that play [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net/) using state-of-the-art Machine Learning! To do so, we have created one of the largest imitation learning datasets with **over 60 million frames** of recorded human player data. Our dataset includes a set of tasks which highlights many of the hardest problems with current techniques: environments with lots of hierarchy, tasks where rewards are sparse, and tasks where rewards are hard to define.
>
> Get started by [installing the environment](https://minerl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html), [running your first agent](https://minerl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/first_agent.html) and by checking out [tasks designed to get you started with MineRL](https://github.com/minerllabs/getting-started-tasks/).

> The MineRL BASALT challenge has no reward functions or technical descriptions of what's to be achieved. Instead, the goal of each task is given as a short natural language string, and the agent is evaluated by a team of human judges who rate both how well the goal has been fulfilled, as well as how human-like the agent behaved. In this video, I interview KAIROS, the winning team of the 2021 challenge, and discuss how they used a combination of machine learning, efficient data collection, hand engineering, and a bit of knowledge about Minecraft to beat all other teams.
