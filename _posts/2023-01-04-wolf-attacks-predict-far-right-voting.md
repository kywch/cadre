> Does the return of large carnivores affect voting behavior? We study this question through the lens of wolf attacks on livestock. 
>
> Sustained environmental conservation has allowed the wolf (*Canis lupus)* to make an impressive and unforeseen comeback across Central Europe in recent years. While lauded by conservationists, local residents often see the wolf as a threat to economic livelihoods, particularly those of farmers. As populists appear to exploit such sentiments, the wolf’s reemergence is a plausible source for far-right voting behavior. 
>
> To test this hypothesis, we collect fine-grained spatial data on wolf attacks and construct a municipality-level panel in Germany. 
>
> Using difference-in-differences models, we find that **wolf attacks are accompanied by a significant rise in far-right voting behavior**, while the Green party, if anything, suffers electoral losses. We buttress this finding using local-level survey data, which confirms a link between wolf attacks and negative sentiment toward environmental protection. 
>
> To explore potential mechanisms, we analyze Twitter posts, election manifestos, and Facebook ads to show that far-right politicians frame the wolf as a threat to economic livelihoods.

> Our evidence extends the scientific literature on environmental change and voting behavior in a number of important ways. Prior research has found that severe weather events can lead citizens to vote for more proenvironmental platforms ([13](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2202224119?utm_source=pocket_saves#core-r13)). The common interpretation of such findings is that witnessing environmental issues first hand leads to attitude change.

> However, this coin may have a flip side: Experiencing wolves killing livestock in one’s vicinity increases the likelihood of voting for far-right, conservation-skeptical parties. Since these parties often oppose measures against climate change, this may lead to a perplexing backlash effect of policies intended to help the environment. Given that many more wolf packs are expected to find territories in Europe—models estimate an increase to up to 1,400 packs in Germany from 150 today ([14](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2202224119?utm_source=pocket_saves#core-r14))—mitigating wolf predation on livestock as effectively as possible and generally finding balanced coexistence policies are key to future conservation and climate protection efforts.
