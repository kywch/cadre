> Across a range of creative domains, individual careers are characterized by hot streaks, which are bursts of high-impact works clustered together in close succession. Yet it remains unclear if there are any regularities underlying the beginning of hot streaks. 
>
> Here, we analyze career histories of artists, film directors, and scientists, and develop deep learning and network science methods to build high-dimensional representations of their creative outputs. 
>
> We find that across all three domains, **individuals tend to explore diverse styles or topics before their hot streak, but become notably more focused after the hot streak begins**. Crucially, hot streaks appear to be associated with neither exploration nor exploitation behavior in isolation, but **a particular sequence of exploration followed by exploitation,** where the transition from exploration to exploitation closely traces the onset of a hot streak. 
>
> Overall, these results may have implications for identifying and nurturing talents across a wide range of creative domains.
