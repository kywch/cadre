Al Pacino best speech - Any Given Sunday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1yWSePMqsk

> The point is that every little bit of effort and help matters. This is why I love startup life, because in an early stage startup every little dollar helps. Every little bit of energy and effort really matters. There is no room for prima donnas and talk without action. Frauds who talk a big game but don’t deliver get found out quickly. This is all in comparison to large corporations where you can hide in the large size of the budgets and organization and also in the complexity and opacity. 

> ***“You find out life’s this game of inches. So is football. Because in either game, life or football, the margin for error is so small -- I mean one-half a step too late, or too early, and you don’t quite make it. One-half second too slow, too fast, you don’t quite catch it.***
>
> ***The inches we need are everywhere around us.***
>
> ***They’re in every break of the game, every minute, every second.***
>
> ***On this team, we fight for that inch. On this team, we tear ourselves and everyone else around us to pieces for that inch. We claw with our fingernails for that inch, because we know when we add up all those inches that’s gonna make the fuckin' difference between winning and losing! Between living and dying'!*** 
>
> ***I’ll tell you this: In any fight, it’s the guy who’s willing to die who’s gonna win that inch. And I know if I’m gonna have any life anymore, it’s because I’m still willing to fight and die for that inch. Because that’s what living is! The six inches in front of your face!!”***

> I think it relates to so many aspects of business and our life. Yes, we should want to make big moves and have lots of massive progress. But sometimes, or most of the time, it’s just about moving a few little inches forward. Every little bit you do actually matters, even if it does not feel like it at the moment. If you sustain this over a long period of time, you may be pleasantly surprised about where you end up.
