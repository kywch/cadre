> We're going to hire some people, so we look at a bunch of resumes and try to decide who's going to make it to the next stage. The best candidates are the ones that are great at both A and B, and we'll obviously bring them in. But some candidates are going to be good at A but not B, or vice versa. So you might choose to evaluate candidates on some combination of the two.

> We can already see something interesting here, which is that the candidates we bring in exhibit a *negative correlation between thing A and B*, despite those being independent. This is something that's called [Berkson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkson's_paradox).

> An [interesting paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24343.pdf) claims a *negative* correlation between sales performance and management performance for sales people promoted into managers. The conclusion is that *“firms prioritize current job performance in promotion decisions at the expense of other observable characteristics that better predict managerial performance”*. While this paper isn't about hiring, it's the exact same theory here: the x-axis would be something like “expected future management ability” and the y-axis “sales performance”.

> Because you're hiring in a market with many other players, the *really* good candidates may simply have so many options that they are going to go to whatever company they want to and make a zillion dollars. Let's say A and B are equally valued by you, as well as the market. Look at the green segment here: now there's an *even stronger negative correlation* between A and B.

> We actually see that the candidates we're interested in went to a *less than average fancy school*. More generally, the conclusion when you're hiring in a competitive market is that *even if you think some quality is desirable, if you think the market overvalues that quality, you should look at the other side of the spectrum*. This goes back to my example about buying a home.

> What my model implies, is that there's an “arbitrage opportunity” here. In fact, it's a bit of a silver lining to the fact that the market is biased. Are companies systematically putting a premium on something? Then bet against them! **Go after the underdogs.** If every hiring manager acts in their own rational self-interest (which unfortunately, they don't) then over time these biases will vanish and the market will converge towards efficiency.
