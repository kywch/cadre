> On making tough decisions and lessons learned.
> - Be decisive. Force yourself as a leader to act early and not wait.
> - Do not let pain make the decision for you, especially when it comes to layoffs. It leads to the wrong decision. For example, you want it to be a 30% layoff but it needs to be a 50% layoff. Do one deep cut, if you do 3 cuts you lose trust.
> - The worst thing you can do as a leader is lie. People always know.
> - In moments of chaos and crisis, communication frequency is important. Be upfront that you can never control nor commit to a future layoff or promotion, instead, be clear on where you stand now, what you are trying to make happen, and what you can do.

> Balancing the long-term mission vs short-term outcomes.
> - Strategy should hurt. Look for the hard places to say no and say no.
> - Fire unprofitable clients by raising prices.
> - Focus infrastructure on what you need today and be careful about making successes feel like failures due to over ambitious goals.

> Reducing compensation across the board as an alternative to layoffs.
> - It’s never enough. Don’t do it.
> - This is kicking a problem down the road that will turn into bigger pain.

> Lightbulb moments.
> - Molly: Direct is kind.
> - Dave: The best leaders will ask if they are first on the layoff list. That is the difference between a manager vs a leader.
> - Ethan: Impact. People think work is impact, impact is delivering results.
