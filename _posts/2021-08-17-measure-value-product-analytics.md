> **What is a value moment?**
> Your product’s value moment is an event, an action, or a series of events and actions that represent the moment that a user found value in your product.
>
> **Which metrics should I pick to measure product success? **
> Think of your value moment as a building block for successful product adoption. More value moments means a user has more opportunities to build a habit around your product and remain a customer in the long term. Turning value into a single key metric (known as the “north star metric” or “focus metric”) can help your teams set tangible goals and measure what really matters.
