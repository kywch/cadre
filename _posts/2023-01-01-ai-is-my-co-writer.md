> What if we can play between these two extremes, and explore the goofy and creative side of AI’s emerging capabilities for writing fiction and generating art? As an AI engineer/researcher and creative writer, I’m fascinated by the ways that incorporating AI into the creative process can change how we tell stories. And in writing for Stories by AI, I have gotten to explore that fascination and discover how AI tools can be leveraged by artists such as myself today.

With this project, I rediscovered approaching writing with an explorer’s mindset, where I’m excited about what might happen without expectations. AI can be a great creative partner: filling in the gaps when you get stuck, or suggesting an offbeat path that you never would have noticed. The human is still at the center though–the human writing, the human steering, and most importantly, the human reading.
