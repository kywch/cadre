> We investigate applications of learner modeling in a computerized adaptive system for practicing factual knowledge. We focus on areas where learners have widely varying degrees of prior knowledge. 
>
> We propose a modular approach to the development of such adaptive practice systems: dissecting the system design into an estimation of prior knowledge, an estimation of current knowledge, and the construction of questions. 
>
> We provide a detailed discussion of learner models for both estimation steps, including a novel use of the Elo rating system for learner modeling. 
>
> We implemented the proposed approach in a system for practising geography facts; the system is widely used and allows us to perform evaluation of all three modules. 
>
> We compare the predictive accuracy of different learner models, discuss insights gained from learner modeling, as well as the impact different variants of the system have on learnersâ€™ engagement and learning.
