> How to identify the students and employees most likely to achieve is a challenge in every field. 
>
> American academic and lay theories alike highlight the importance of passion for strong achievement. Based on a Western independent model of motivation, passionate individuals—those who have a strong interest, demonstrate deep enjoyment, and express confidence in what they are doing—are considered future achievers. Those with less passion are thought to have less potential and are often passed over for admission or employment. 
>
> As academic institutions and corporations in the increasingly multicultural world seek to acquire talent from across the globe, can they assume that passion is an equally strong predictor of achievement across cultural contexts? 
>
> We address this question with three representative samples totaling 1.2 million students in 59 societies and provide empirical evidence of a systematic, cross-cultural variation in the importance of passion in predicting achievement. 
>
> **In individualistic societies where independent models of motivation are prevalent, ** relative to collectivistic societies where interdependent models of motivation are more common, **passion predicts a larger gain (0.32 vs. 0.21 SD) and explains more variance in achievement (37% vs. 16%).** 
>
> **In contrast, in collectivistic societies, parental support predicts achievement over and above passion.** 
>
> These findings suggest that in addition to passion, achievement may be fueled by striving to realize connectedness and meet family expectations. Findings highlight **the risk of overweighting passion** in admission and employment decisions and the need to understand and develop measures for the multiple sources and forms of motivation that support achievement.
