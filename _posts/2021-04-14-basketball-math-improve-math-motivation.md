> This study investigated whether 6 weeks of basketball combined with mathematics once a week in physical education lessons could improve children's motivation for mathematics.
>
> Seven hundred fifty-seven children (mean age = 10.4 years, age range: 7–12 years) were randomly selected to have either basketball combined with mathematics once a week (BM) or to have basketball sessions without mathematics (CON). Children in BM and CON motivation for classroom-based mathematics were measured using the Academic Self-Regulation Questionnaire (SRQ-A) before (T0) and after the intervention (T1). Among the BM, levels of intrinsic motivation, feelings of competence, and autonomy were measured using the Post-Experimental Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) questionnaire acutely after a basketball session combined with mathematics and immediately after a session of classroom-based mathematics.
>
> BM had significantly higher acute levels of perceived autonomy (+14.24%, *p* < 0.0001), competencies (+6.33%, *p* < 0.0001), and intrinsic motivation (+16.09%, *p* < 0.0001) during basketball sessions combined with mathematics compared to when having classroom-based mathematics. A significant decrease in the mean for intrinsic motivation was observed from T0 to T1 for CON (−9.38%, *p* < 0.001), but not for BM (−0.39%, *p* = 0.98). BM had a more positive development in intrinsic motivation compared to CON from T0 to T1 (*p* = 0.006), meaning that BM had a positive influence on children's intrinsic motivation for classroom-based mathematics. 
>
> This study indicates that basketball combined with mathematics is an intrinsically motivating way to practice mathematics, which also has a positive influence on children's general intrinsic motivation for mathematics in the classroom.
