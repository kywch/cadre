> Trust in leaders is central to citizen compliance with public policies. 
>
> One potential determinant of trust is how leaders resolve conflicts between utilitarian and non-utilitarian ethical principles in moral dilemmas. Past research suggests that utilitarian responses to dilemmas can both erode and enhance trust in leaders: sacrificing some people to save many others (‘instrumental harm’) reduces trust, while maximizing the welfare of everyone equally (‘impartial beneficence’) may increase trust. 
>
> In a multi-site experiment spanning 22 countries on six continents, participants (*N* = 23,929) completed self-report (*N* = 17,591) and behavioural (*N* = 12,638) measures of trust in leaders who endorsed utilitarian or non-utilitarian principles in dilemmas concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. 
>
> **Across both the self-report and behavioural measures, endorsement of instrumental harm decreased trust, while endorsement of impartial beneficence increased trust.** These results show how support for different ethical principles can impact trust in leaders, and inform effective public communication during times of global crisis.
