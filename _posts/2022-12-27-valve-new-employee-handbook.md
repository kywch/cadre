> A fearless adventure in knowing what to do when no one's there telling you what to do

> **How do I decide which things to work on?**
>
> * Of all the projects currently under way, what's the most valuable thing I can be working on?
> * Which project will have the highest direct impact on our customers? How much will the work I ship benefit them?
> * Is Valve not doing something that it should be doing?
> * What's interesting? What's rewarding? What leverages my individual strengths the most?

> The most successful poeple at Valve are both (1) highly skilled at a broad set of things and (2) world-class experts within a more narrow discipline. (T-shaped people) Because of the talent diversity here at Valve, it's often easier to become stronger at things that aren't your core skill set.

> * **Engineers: code is only the beginning**: you are now surrounded by a multidisciplinary group of experts in all kinds of fields -- creative, legal, financial, even psychological. Many of these people are probably sitting in the same room as you every day, so the opportunities for learning are huge. Take advantage of this fact whenever possible: the more you can learn about the mechanics, vocabulary, and analysis within other disciplines, the more valuable you become.
> * **Non-Engineers: program or be programmed**: Valve's core competency is making software. Obviously, different disciplines are part of making our products, but we're still an engineering-centric company. That's because the core fo the software-building process is engineering. If your expertise is not in writing code, then every bit of energy you put into understanding the code-writing part of making software is to your (and Valve's) benefit. .. **Broadening your awareness in a highly technical direction is never a bad thing.**
