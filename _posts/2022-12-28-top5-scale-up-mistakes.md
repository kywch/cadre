> I’d move to scale-up, and specifically the things that can go wrong as you scale a company from $10M to $100M in ARR. Even if your company is still below $10M, I think you’ll enjoy the presentation because it will provide you with a preview of what lies ahead and hopefully help you avoid common mistakes as you enter the scale-up stage.

> - **Premature go-to-market acceleration**. Stepping on the gas too hard, too early and wasting millions of dollars because you thought (and/or wanted to believe) you had a repeatable sales model when you didn’t. This is, by far, the top scale-up mistake. Making it costs not only time and money, but takes a heavy toll on morale and culture.
>
> * **Putting, or more often, keeping, people in the wrong roles**. Everybody knows that the people who helped you build the company from $0 to $10M aren’t necessarily the best people to lead it from $10 to $100M, but what do you do about that? How do you combine loyalists and veterans going forward? What do you do with loyalists who are past their sell-by date in their current role?
> * **Losing focus**. At one startup I ran, I felt like the board thought their job was to distract me — and they were pretty good at it. What do you do when the board, like an overbearing parent, is burying you in ideas and directive feedback? And that’s not mention all the other distraction factors from the market, customers, and the organization itself. How does one stay focused? And on what?
> * **Messing up international (USA) expansion**. This is a European conference so I’ll focus on the mistakes that I see European companies make as they expand into the USA. Combining my Business Objects experience with my Nuxeo and Scoro board experience with both Balderton and non-Balderton advising, I’m getting pretty deep on this subject, so I’m writing a [series on it](https://www.balderton.com/build/the-top-5-mistakes-european-technology-startups-make-in-us-expansion/) for the [Balderton Build](https://www.balderton.com/build/) blog. This material will echo that content.
> * **Accumulating debilitating technical debt**. “I wear the chain I forged in life,” said [Jacob Marley](https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/christmascarol/quotes/character/jacob-marley/) in A Christmas Carol and so it is with your product. Every shortcut, every mistake, every bad design decision, every redundant piece of code, every poor architectural choice, every hack accumulates to the point where, if ignored, it can paralyze your product development. Pick your metaphor — Marley’s chains, [barnacles](https://seahistory.org/sea-history-for-kids/worms-and-barnacles-and-algae-oh-my/) on a ship, a [house of cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_cards), or [Fibber McGee’s closet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9FGC68YcwM) — but ignore this at your peril. It takes 10-12 years to get to an IPO and that’s just about the right amount of time to paralyze yourself with technical debt. What can you do to avoid having a product crisis as you approach your biggest milestone?
