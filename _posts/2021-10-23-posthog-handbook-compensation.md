> You can use our calculator below to work out what your salary would be for a few example roles. We think the fastest possible shipping comes from a leaner, stronger team, so we try to pay top of market. We pay well, so you'll work with the best people in the world.
>
> We use [Option Impact](https://www.advanced-hr.com/products-overview) as our main source for our salary benchmark. However, we sometimes gather additional data sets, which includes [Payscale](https://www.payscale.com/), [salary.com](https://www.salary.com/), reported salary on Glassdoor and LinkedIn, and other available sources. We try to have a data set that is as big as possible to reduce the margin for error and add a 1.2x multiplier to the median salary.
>
> For hiring into executive roles, we usually use a separate database of compensation benchmarks rather than this calculator. The terms of access to this database means that we're unfortunately not able to share it publicly.
>
> As part of your compensation, you will receive share options in the company with a standard 1-year cliff, 4-year vest. Broadly, the amount of options will depend on the Level as per the Experience Factor. We may change this policy from time to time depending on our rate of hiring - e.g. if we had a gap in hiring for an extended period, we would adjust this.

> Whilst the terms of options for *any company* could vary if we were ever acquired, we have set them up with the following key terms:
>
> - 10 years to exercise your options in the event that you leave PostHog
> - Double trigger acceleration, which means if you are let go or forced to leave due to the company being acquired, you receive all of your options at that time
> - Vesting starts from your start date (not after a "probation period" or similar)
> - For UK-based team members, our options are part of the [EMI share options scheme](https://www.gov.uk/tax-employee-share-schemes/enterprise-management-incentives-emis), which is tax-advantaged
