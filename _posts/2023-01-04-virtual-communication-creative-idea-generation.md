> COVID-19 accelerated a decade-long shift to remote work by normalizing working from home on a large scale. Indeed, 75% of US employees in a 2021 survey reported a personal preference for working remotely at least one day per week[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04643-y#ref-CR1), and studies estimate that 20% of US workdays will take place at home after the pandemic ends[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04643-y#ref-CR2).

> In a laboratory study and a field experiment across five countries (in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia), we show that **videoconferencing inhibits the production of creative ideas**.

> **By contrast, when it comes to selecting which idea to pursue, we find no evidence that videoconferencing groups are less effective (and preliminary evidence that they may be more effective) than in-person groups**.

> Departing from previous theories that focus on how oral and written technologies limit the synchronicity and extent of information exchanged[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04643-y#ref-CR4),[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04643-y#ref-CR5),[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04643-y#ref-CR6), we find that our effects are driven by differences in the physical nature of videoconferencing and in-person interactions. Specifically, using eye-gaze and recall measures, as well as latent semantic analysis, we demonstrate that **videoconferencing hampers idea generation because it focuses communicators on a screen, which prompts a narrower cognitive focus**. Our results suggest that virtual interaction comes with a cognitive cost for creative idea generation.

> **Importantly, unexpected prop recall and gaze around the room were both significantly associated with an increased number of creative ideas** (room recall: negative binomial regression, *n* = 151 pairs, *b* = 0.09, s.e. = 0.03, *z* = 2.82, *P* = 0.005; room gaze: negative binomial regression, *n* = 146 pairs, *b* = 0.003, s.e. = 0.001, *z* = 3.14, *P* = 0.002), and both of these measures independently mediated the effect of modality on idea generation (10,000 nonparametric bootstraps, recall: 95% CI = −0.61 to −0.01; gaze: 95% CI = −1.14 to −0.08; Extended Data Figs. [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04643-y#Fig4) and [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04643-y#Fig5)). This combination of analyses converges on the view that virtual communication narrows visual focus, which subsequently hampers idea generation.
