> Our knowledge of the effect of a specific lack of education on the brain and cognitive development is currently poor but is highly relevant given differences between countries in their educational curricula and the differences in opportunities to access education. 
>
> We show that within the same society, **adolescent students who specifically lack mathematical education exhibited reduced brain inhibition levels in a key brain area involved in reasoning and cognitive learning.** 
>
> **Importantly, these brain inhibition levels predicted mathematical attainment âˆ¼19 mo later,** suggesting they play a role in neuroplasticity. 
>
> Our study provides biological understanding of the impact of the lack of mathematical education on the developing brain and the mutual play between biology and education.
