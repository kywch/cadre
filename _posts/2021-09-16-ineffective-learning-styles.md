> The learning styles meshing hypothesis explains that individuals have preferred learning styles (e.g. auditory, visual, etc.) and that instruction that matches that preference will improve learning. This theory has no empirical evidence to support it and it’s a bit dangerous. I once had a student inform me that they would be dropping my class because it was too auditory and they were a visual learner – it would be impossible for them to learn from me. They thought they were *unable* to learn in another way. Similarly, it’s a heavy burden on instructors to differentiate learning in this way, catering to individual styles.

My understanding of this paper is that study materials should dictate teaching strategy, unless students cannot access it due to deficit. For example, trying to teach hard-to-verbalize information (like faces or relative direction) using verbal instructions was shown to be less effective. 

This paper also showed that individuals' learning strategies, which may be associated with one's verbal and visual cognitive styles, can be changed by teaching instructions, suggesting that optimizing teaching instructions is more efficient than preparing separate instructions for different learning styles.
