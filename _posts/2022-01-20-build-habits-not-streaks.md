> I created Forte² because I was unhappy with the state of habit trackers on the App Store.

> Typical habit trackers focus on streaks as the primary metric to track habit building. The problem with this is that users can build up this streak for weeks or months just to have it set back to zero in one day. In my experience, this is extremely demotivating and one study on habit formation showed missing one day did not have any affect on forming habits.

> That is why tracking streaks can be unhelpful in the long term. Forte² is different. Forte² calculates a score based on every time you complete (or don't) a habit each day. **Failing one day will set your score back a bit, but won't reset it back to zero, giving you the opportunity to quickly get back on track.**
