> The ability to think creatively is paramount to facing new challenges, but how creativity arises remains mysterious. 
>
> Here, we show that the brain activity common to the twilight zone between sleep and wakefulness (nonrapid eye movement sleep stage 1 or N1) ignites creative sparks. 
>
> Participants (*N* = 103) were exposed to mathematical problems without knowing that a hidden rule allowed solving them almost instantly. We found that **spending at least 15 s in N1 during a resting period tripled the chance to discover the hidden rule (83% versus 30% when participants remained awake), and this effect vanished if subjects reached deeper sleep.** 
>
> Our findings suggest that there is a creative sweet spot within the sleep-onset period, and hitting it requires individuals balancing falling asleep easily against falling asleep too deeply.
