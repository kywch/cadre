> Drawing on research conducted by Mayer (2020), this article examines evidence-based principles for how to design effective instructional videos and shows how they are grounded in cognitive theories of learning and instruction. 
>
> Principles include 
> - multimedia (present words and graphics), 
> - coherence (avoid extraneous material in slides and script), 
> - signaling (highlight key material), 
> - redundancy (do not add captions that repeat the spoken words), 
> - spatial contiguity (place printed text next to corresponding part of graphic), 
> - temporal contiguity (present corresponding visual and verbal material at the same time), 
> - segmenting (break a complex slide into progressively presented parts), 
> - pre-training (provide pre-training in the names and characteristics of key concepts), 
> - modality (present words as spoken text), 
> - personalization (use conversational language), 
> - voice (use appealing human voice), 
> - image (do not display static image of instructor's face), 
> - embodiment (display gesturing instructor), 
> - and generative activity (add prompts for generative learning activity).

> **Table 1. Three principles from the Science of Learning**
> - Dual channels: People have separate channels for processing visual and verbal information
> - Limited capacity: People can process only a few items in each channel in working memory at any one time
> - Active learning: Meaning learning requires that learners engage in appropriate cognitive processing during learning, including selecting, organizing, and integrating
