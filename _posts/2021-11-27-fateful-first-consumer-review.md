> This paper uncovers the striking power of a product’s first consumer review. 
>
> Our analytical model suggests that two key metrics of online consumer reviews, valence and volume, are not independent, but instead evolve interdependently. This interdependence forms a mechanism to transfer **a (dis)advantage from a product’s first review to both a *long-lasting* (dis)advantage in future word-of-mouth (WOM) valence and an *increasing* (dis)advantage in future WOM volume. As a result, a single consumer review can significantly influence the fate of a given product. **

> These theoretical predictions, although seemingly unlikely, are supported by our empirical investigations.

> For example, more than 30% of vacuum cleaner models offered by both [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) and [BestBuy.com](http://bestbuy.com/) receive first reviews of opposite valence on the two platforms. Those with a negative first review subsequently suffer a loss in both valence and volume vis-à-vis their counterparts with a positive first review, even after 36 months. More strikingly, the first-review effect on WOM volume increases over time.

> Our findings reveal a crucial weakness in the user-generated information mechanism. As a consumption-based information source, it creates an information-availability bias such that **when a product receives a negative first review, it not only suffers low initial sales, but also loses the opportunity to correct the possible negative bias via subsequent reviews.** These findings have substantial implications for online sellers, e-commerce platform providers, and consumers.
