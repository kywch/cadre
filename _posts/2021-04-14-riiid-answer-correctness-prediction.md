Kaggle AIEd Challenge 2020 Winners announced in [https://sites.google.com/view/tipce-2021]

> This year, the company released EdNet, the world’s largest open database for AI education containing more than 100 million student interactions.
>
> In this competition, your challenge is to create algorithms for "Knowledge Tracing," the modeling of student knowledge over time. The goal is to accurately predict how students will perform on future interactions. You will pair your machine learning skills using Riiid’s EdNet data.

> **Kaggle 2nd place solution with an explanation paper**
> - [LSTM-SAKT: LSTM-encoded SAKT-like transformer for knowledge tracing (Oya & Morishima, 2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00845.pdf)
>   - Kaggle notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/mamasinkgs/public-private-2nd-place-solution
