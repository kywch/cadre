> Countering misinformation can reduce belief in the moment, but corrective messages quickly fade from memory. We tested whether the longer-term impact of fact-checks depends on when people receive them. 
>
> In two experiments (total *N =* 2,683), participants read true and false headlines taken from social media. In the treatment conditions, “true” and “false” tags appeared before, during, or after participants read each headline. Participants in a control condition received no information about veracity. One week later, participants in all conditions rated the same headlines’ accuracy. 

> We found consistent evidence that the timing of fact-checks matters: **“True” and “false” tags that appeared immediately after headlines (debunking) reduced misclassification of headlines 1 wk later by 25.3%**, compared to an 8.6% reduction when tags appeared during exposure (labeling), and a 6.6% increase (Experiment 1) or 5.7% reduction (Experiment 2) when tags appeared beforehand (prebunking).
