> If you’re worried that your employees are eyeing the door, it’s time to start having some important career-defining conversations. In this piece, executive coach Susan Peppercorn outlines five questions to start asking your direct reports so that you can get a better sense of how they’re feeling about their positions: 
>
> 1. **How would you like to grow within this organization?** 
>
>    two-thirds of people — regardless of their level — leave their company because of a lack of career-development opportunities.
>
>    you might also ask, “What role would love to do (whether it exists or not), and what can I do as your manager to encourage your development in this company?”
>
> 2. **Do you feel a sense of purpose in your job?** 
>
> 3. **What do you need from me to do your best work?** 
>
>    These supportive behaviors build a work environment where employees feel safe experimenting with new ideas, sharing information, exploring development opportunities, and supporting each other.
>
>    As you explore what your employees need to do their best work, you might also ask, “What is your biggest frustration, and what action can I take to help you deal with it? What have you been trying to tell me that I’ve not been hearing? How would you like to be recognized?”
>
> 4. **What are we currently not doing as a company that you feel we should do?** 
>
>    By asking individual team members what they feel the company could be doing better, what market opportunities the organization might be overlooking, and how to leverage company resources more effectively, you’re validating that their thoughts matter.
>
>    You might also ask things like, “Are you satisfied with our current work from home/hybrid policy? If not, what do you think needs to change? How satisfied are you with the tools you use to communicate with your colleagues when working remotely?”
>
> 5. **Do you have the opportunity to do what you do best every day?** 
>
>    To determine whether your employees are focusing on their strengths, you might also ask, “What is the best part of your job? Which of your talents are you not using in your current role? What part of your job would you eliminate if you could?”
>
> When managers make checking in with these five questions a regular part of how they interact with their employees, it helps ensure that people feel seen and valued. And when managers help individuals on their teams feel that way, they’re more likely to be rewarded by employees who become advocates for the department and organization, no matter how long they stay.

> In a recent [Gallup study](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/247391/fixable-problem-costs-businesses-trillion.aspx), more than half of employees surveyed said that no one — including their manager — had talked to them about how they were feeling in their role in their last three months before they quit. And 52% of exiting employees stressed that their manager or organization could have done something to prevent them from leaving their job.
