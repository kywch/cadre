> While the gig economy provides flexible jobs for millions of workers globally, a lack of organization identity and coworker bonds contributes to their low engagement and high attrition rates. 
>
> To test the impact of virtual teams on worker productivity and retention, we conduct a field experiment with 27,790 drivers on a ride-sharing platform. We organize drivers into teams that are **randomly assigned to receiving their team ranking, or individual ranking within their team, or individual performance information (control)**. 
>
> We find that treated drivers work longer hours and generate significantly higher revenue. Furthermore, **drivers in the team-ranking treatment continue to be more engaged 3 mo after the end of the experiment**. 
>
> A machine-learning analysis of 149 team contests in 86 cities suggests that **social comparison, driver experience, and within-team similarity are the key predictors of the virtual team efficacy**.

> Within-team diversity in productivity activates social comparison that increases below-median workersâ€™ effort, whereas within-team similarity in natural identities facilitates team communication and friendship formation.
